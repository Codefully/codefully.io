      We use technology for creating solutions. Technology is not a self-serving cause. Remember
      that the technology may fizzle out but the problem you are trying to solve will most likely
      still be there.
    </p>
    <h3 className={classes.subtitle}>Opinionated development above blind implementation</h3>
    <p className={classes.text}>
      We donâ€™t just execute. We consider our clients equal partners and we view ourselves as
      responsible for the overall success of a project. We voice our opinion and provide strong
      guidance.
    </p>
    <h3 className={classes.subtitle}>People above projects</h3>
    <p className={classes.text}>
      We choose what we work on based on the teams that are involved. We believe that success
      requires good chemistry and we consciously spend effort building great working relationships.
    </p>
    <h3 className={classes.subtitle}>Accessibility over rigid relationships</h3>
    <p className={classes.text}>
      We are easy to talk to and always make sure that our customers can easily reach us. Building
      software is a collaborative process and communication is key. We believe that developers and
      product owners should be in tune.
