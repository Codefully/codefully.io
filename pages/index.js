              Since 2010 we design and implement solutions for companies of all
              sizes and from different industries. We produced applications that
              dramatically improved aspects of business processes. We helped
              companies turn their data into insights. We solved problems like
              managing complicated sales contracts for distributor networks or
              getting custom sales analytics and reports on demand and on
              schedule. We developed customer rewards management systems, as
              well as risk, and innovation management systems.
