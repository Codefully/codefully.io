            Since 2010 we design and implement solutions for companies of all
            sizes and from different industries. We produced applications that
            dramatically improved aspects of business processes. We helped
            companies turn their data into insights. We solved problems like
            managing complicated sales contracts for distributor networks or
            getting custom sales analytics and reports on demand and on
            schedule. We developed customer rewards management systems, as well
            as risk, and innovation management systems.
